The following are problems you might encounter. Given the following function, find the average rate of change over the given intervals. \\(f(x)= 10x^3 +10 \\qquad a)[5,7] \\quad b)[-3,3]\\) For solving this problem, I am going to use the slope formula, which can take many form. \\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\\\ m = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1))}{x_2 - x_1}\\] Time to do the Math \\[m = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1))}{x_2 - x_1}\\\\ m = \\frac{f(5) - f(7)}{5 - 7}\\\\ m = \\frac{10x^3 + 10 - 10x^3 + 10}{5 - 7}\\\\ m = \\frac{10(5)^3 + 10 - 10(7)^3 + 10}{5 - 7}\\\\ m = \\frac{1260 - 3440}{5 - 7}\\\\ m = 1090 \\] With that said, the slope is 1090 on the interval [5,7] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
